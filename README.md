## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean expressions.

- **AND (&&)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **OR (||)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **NOT (!)**: Inverts the value of the operand.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

- **Equal to (==)**: Returns true if both operands are equal.
- **Not equal to (!=)**: Returns true if operands are not equal.
- **Greater than (>)**: Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right.
- **Less than (<)**: Returns true if the left operand is less than the right.
- **Greater than or equal to (>=)**: Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
- **Less than or equal to (<=)**: Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- **Assignment (=)**: Assigns the right operand's value to the left operand.
- **Add and assign (+=)**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Subtract and assign (-=)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Multiply and assign (*=)**: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Divide and assign (/=)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- **Modulus and assign (%=)**: Takes the modulus using the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform bit-level operations on operands.

- **AND (&)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation.
- **OR (|)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation.
- **XOR (^)**: Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.
- **NOT (~)**: Inverts all the bits of the operand.
- **Left shift (<<)**: Shifts bits to the left by the specified number of positions.
- **Right shift (>>)**: Shifts bits to the right by the specified number of positions.
